                    <p>Amidst the upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I stumbled upon a newfound passion that has since
                        become the cornerstone of my journey: coding. As the world slowed down, I delved into the intricacies of
                        programming, captivated by its limitless possibilities and the power to create something tangible from
                        mere lines of code. Since that pivotal moment, I have devoted myself wholeheartedly to mastering this craft,
                        constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Coding has not just become a hobby or a career pathâ€”it
                        has become an integral part of who I am, driving me forward with an insatiable curiosity and a relentless
                        pursuit of excellence.
